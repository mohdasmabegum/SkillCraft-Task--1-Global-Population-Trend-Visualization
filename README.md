# SkillCraft-Task--1-Global-Population-Trend-Visualization
Analyzed large-scale World Bank population datasets to identify global and regional growth patterns across 60+ years. Implemented data transformation techniques, including melting and reshaping DataFrames, to prepare raw CSV data for time-series analysis. Designed high-impact visual dashboards featuring bar charts and histograms .
  # Population Trend Analysis & Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing global population data using the World Bank dataset. The primary goal was to process raw demographic data to identify historical growth patterns and compare population distributions across different years and regions, with a specific focus on India's growth from 1960 to 2024.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

## Key Features
* **[span_0](start_span)Data Wrangling:** Cleaned and transformed raw CSV data, including melting dataframes to convert wide-format year columns into long-format for analysis[span_0](end_span).
* **[span_1](start_span)Time-Series Visualization:** Developed bar charts and histograms to show population shifts over six decades[span_1](end_span).
* **[span_2](start_span)Focused Analysis:** Extracted and visualized specific trends for the Indian subcontinent to illustrate rapid demographic changes[span_2](end_span).

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
